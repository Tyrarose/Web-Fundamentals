		<h1>Killjoy</h1>
		<img src="image.jpg" alt="Joe Schmoe">
		<p>Killjoy is the latest Valorant agent to be revealed and will be the 12th one added to the roster. She officially went live at the beginning of Act II which began on August 4th, 2020. Overall, she’s the third Sentinel agent and her playstyle is somewhat similar to Cypher + Raze. 

		This is because she has a wide range of gadgets that she can place all over the map to not only gain info, but also set up or get kills. This guide will cover how Killjoy works as well as her overall strengths and weaknesses. Our takes are primarily first impressions before her launch but come back later and we’ll have a more fleshed out guide for you.

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Nanoswarm</td>
		    <td>C – 200 credits, up to 2 charges</td>
		    <td>A grenade that turns invisible and is remotely detonated like Cypher’s cages. It deals a high amount of damage and can kill enemies very quickly if they don’t leave its radius quickly.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Alarmbot </td>
		    <td>Q – 200 credits </td>
		    <td>Equips and deploys an invisible bot that acts like a proximity mine, jumping to an enemy that comes within its range and explodes. </td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Turret</td>
		    <td>E – free, can be placed again 20 seconds after recalling or 45 seconds after being destroyed</td>
		    <td>Deploys a turret that fires on enemies within a 180 degree cone.</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Lockdown </td>
		    <td>7 orb points</td>
		    <td>The source of this agent’s name is most likely inspired by her ultimate, which places a device that emits a bubble dome in a large radius. After 13 seconds, it will detonate. All enemies who are hit will be severely slowed and unable to use their gun or abilities for 8 seconds.</td>
